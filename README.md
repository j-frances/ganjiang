# ganjiang 赣江
The Gan River travels 885 km north through the western part of Jiangxi before flowing into Lake Poyang and thus the Yangtze River。 On its east bank is one of the Three Great Towers of southern China, The Pavillion of Prince 滕王阁。

Although it has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over its history, the Pavillion was rebuilt may times, each with more splendour and majesty than the last.
